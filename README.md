# Optimising Optical Circuits for Entanglement States

We use machine learning to optimise the parameters of an optical circuit towards generating high quality quantum resource states (in particular, we employ the global optimisation algorithm *basinhopping*). These resource states are needed to perform noiseless linear amplification with the highest possible success probabilities, as discussed in our paper "Saturating the Maximum Success Probability Bound for Noiseless Linear Amplification using Linear Optics" [[1](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.04274)]. 

We acknowledge the papers "Production of photonic universal quantum gates enhanced by machine learning" [[2](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.012326)] and "Progress towards practical qubit computation using approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes" [[3](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.032315)], whose code we have used and modified here for our own purposes. We also acknowledge the libraries *strawberryfields* [[4](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2019-03-11-129)] and *thewarlus* [[5](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01705)], which we used to perform the quantum simulation.
