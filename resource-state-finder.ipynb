Background\n","\n","In this notebook, we use machine learning to optimise the parameters of an optical circuit towards generating high quality quantum resource states (in particular, we employ the global optimisation algorithm *basinhopping*). These resource states are needed to perform noiseless linear amplification with the highest possible success probabilities, as discussed in our paper \"Saturating the Maximum Success Probability Bound for Noiseless Linear Amplification using Linear Optics\" [1]. We have separated this notebook into three sections:\n","\n","Section 1: All the necessary libraries are imported.\n","\n","Section 2: The functions that allows us to simulate an optical circuit are prepared, and then verified to check that they work.  \n","\n","Section 3: The *basinhopping* algorithm is prepared, and an example optimisation is run to illustrate to the user how it works.  \n","\n","Finally, we acknowledge the papers \"Production of photonic universal quantum gates enhanced by machine learning\" [[2](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.012326)] and \"Progress towards practical qubit computation using approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes\" [[3](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.032315)], whose code we have used and modified here for our own purposes. We also acknowledge the libraries *strawberryfields* [[4](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2019-03-11-129)] and *thewarlus* [[5](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01705)], which we used to perform the quantum simulation.\n","\n","[1] J.
